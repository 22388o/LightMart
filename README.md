Lightning Marketplace

LightMart is a simple & swift two-party marketplace that uses the Lightning Network. The statements OP IF and OP ENDIF allow for conditional execution based on whether the buyer and seller used a multi-sig address to deposit funds into the Lightning Network channel.

Following the deposit of funds by both parties, the buyer can place an order by providing order details and locking funds into the multi-sig address. The seller can then accept the order by signing and releasing the funds to the buyer.


Addtional features that could be added in LightMart, which may have to interact with third party services, include the following:

+ Order Tracking: To ensure a smooth transaction process, implement a tracking system that allows buyers and sellers to track their orders and file disputes if there are any problems.

+ Escrow: Escrow services can be used to provide buyers and sellers with additional security. A portion of the payment, for example, can be held in escrow until the buyer receives the product or service and confirms that it is as described.

+ Ratings & Reviews: Allowing buyers and sellers to rate and review one another can help build trust and credibility in the marketplace.

+ Auctions: A system in which buyers bid on items and the highest bidder wins the item can be implemented.

+ Multiple Currency Support: The marketplace can be cultivated in a way to cater to buyers and sellers from various countries.

+ Integration with third-party services: To provide a more streamlined experience, the marketplace can be integrated with third-party services such as shipping providers, payment processors, and tax calculation, etc.

+ Clarity: Clarity smart contracts can be used to automate certain aspects of the transaction process, such as releasing funds after the buyer has received the product or service.

It is important to note that LightMart is not a complete marketplace, it has not been audited, the legal implications have not been explored prior to the publishing of this open source script and the potential tax implications of LightMart may carry varying outputs of fiscal responisbility in various jurisdictions around the world. Use at your own risk. 

NoCodeClarity believes in the power of Bitcoin and Bitcoin layers such as Lightning so it's important that LightMart is open source, especially as a hackathon submission for the [2023 MIT Bitcoin Hackathon](https://mitbitcoin.devpost.com/).
